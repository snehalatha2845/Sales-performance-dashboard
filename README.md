# Sales Performance Dashboard

This Power BI project provides an insightful sales dashboard built using retail beverage sales data from across the United States. It helps track key performance indicators such as total sales, operating profit, operating margin, and units sold.

The dashboard enables users to filter and analyze sales performance by beverage brand, retailer name, and location. It offers comparative insights on top-performing brands and retailers, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and distribution strategies.

Key visuals include bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, line graphs, and slicers. The dashboard is interactive, user-friendly, and supports drill-down analysis to identify trends and improvement areas in sales performance.
